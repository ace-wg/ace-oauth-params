      Additional OAuth Parameters for Authorization in Constrained
                           Environments (ACE)
                     draft-ietf-ace-oauth-params-00

Abstract

   This specification defines new parameters for the OAuth 2.0 token and
   introspection endpoints when used with framework for authentication
   and authorization for constrained environments (ACE).  These are used
   to express the desired audience of a requested access token, the
   desired proof-of-possession key, the proof-of-possession key that the
   AS has selected, and the key the RS should use to authenticate to the
   client.

1.  Introduction

   The Authentication and Authorization for Constrained Environments
   (ACE) specification [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz] requires some new
   parameters for interactions with the OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] token and
   introspection endpoints, as well as some new claims to be used in
   access tokens.  These parameters and claims can also be used in other
   contexts, and may need to be updated to align them with ongoing OAuth
   work.  Therefore they have been split out into this document, which
   can be used and updated independently of [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz].

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Readers are assumed to be familiar with the terminology from
   [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz].

   Note that the term "endpoint" is used here following its OAuth 2.0
   [RFC6749] definition, which is to denote resources such as token and
   introspection at the AS and authz-info at the RS.  The CoAP [RFC7252]
   definition, which is "An entity participating in the CoAP protocol"
   is not used in this specification.

3.  Parameters for the Token Endpoint

3.1.  Client-to-AS Request

   This document defines the following additional parameters for
   requesting an access token from a token endpoint in the ACE framework
   [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz]:

   req_aud
      OPTIONAL.  Specifies the audience for which the client is
      requesting an access token.  If this parameter is missing, it is
      assumed that the AS has a default audience for access tokens
      issued to this client.  If a client submits a request for an
      access token without specifying a "req_aud" parameter, and the AS
      does not have a default audience value for this client, then the
      AS MUST respond with an error message using a response code
      equivalent to the CoAP response code 4.00 (Bad Request).  Values
      of this parameter follow the syntax of the "aud" claim from
      section 3.1.3 of [RFC8392].

   req_cnf
      OPTIONAL.  This field contains information about the key the
      client would like to bind to the access token for proof-of-
      possession.  It is RECOMMENDED that an AS reject a request
      containing a symmetric key value in the 'req_cnf' field, since the
      AS is expected to be able to generate better symmetric keys than a
      potentially constrained client.  Values of this parameter follow
      the syntax of the "cnf" claim from section 3.1 of
      [I-D.ietf-ace-cwt-proof-of-possession].

3.2.  AS-to-Client Response

   This document defines the following additional parameters for an AS
   response to a request to the token endpoint:

   cnf
      REQUIRED if the token type is "pop" and a symmetric key is used.
      MAY be present for asymmetric proof-of-possession keys.  This
      field contains the proof-of-possession key that the AS selected

Internet-Draft              ACE-OAuth-Params               November 2018


      for the token.  Values of this parameter follow the syntax of the
      "cnf" claim from section 3.1 of
      [I-D.ietf-ace-cwt-proof-of-possession].  See Section 5 for details
      on the use of this parameter.

   rs_cnf
      OPTIONAL if the token type is "pop" and asymmetric keys are used.
      MUST NOT be present otherwise.  This field contains information
      about the public key used by the RS to authenticate.  If this
      parameter is absent, either the RS does not use a public key or
      the AS assumes that the client already knows the public key of the
      RS.  Values of this parameter follow the syntax of the "cnf" claim
      from section 3.1 of [I-D.ietf-ace-cwt-proof-of-possession].  See
      Section 5 for details on the use of this parameter.

4.  Parameters for the Introspection Endpoint

4.1.  AS-to-RS Response

   This document defines the following additional parameters for an AS
   response to a request to the introspection endpoint:

   cnf
      OPTIONAL.  This field contains information about the proof-of-
      possession key that binds the client to the access token.  Values
      of this parameter follow the syntax of the "cnf" claim from
      section 3.1 of [I-D.ietf-ace-cwt-proof-of-possession].  See
      Section 5 for more details on the use of the "cnf" parameter.

   rs_cnf
      OPTIONAL.  If the RS uses asymmetric keys to authenticate towards
      the client (e.g. with a DTLS-RPK handshake) and it has several
      such keys (e.g. for different elliptic curves), the AS can give
      the RS a hint using this parameter, as to which key it should use.
      Values of this parameter follow the syntax of the "cnf" claim from
      section 3.1 of [I-D.ietf-ace-cwt-proof-of-possession].  See
      Section 5 for details on the use of this parameter.

5.  Confirmation Method Parameters

   The confirmation method parameters are used as follows:

   o  "req_cnf" in the token request C -> AS, OPTIONAL to indicate the
      client's raw public key, or the key-identifier of a previously
      established key between C and RS that the client wishes to use for
      proof-of-possession of the access token.
   o  "cnf" in the token response AS -> C, OPTIONAL if using an
      asymmetric key or a key that the client requested via a key



Seitz                     Expires May 12, 2019                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft              ACE-OAuth-Params               November 2018


      identifier in the request.  REQUIRED if the client didn't specify
      a "req_cnf" and symmetric keys are used.  Used to indicate the
      symmetric key generated by the AS for proof-of-possession of the
      access token.
   o  "cnf" in the introspection response AS -> RS, REQUIRED if the
      token that was subject to introspection is a proof-of-possession
      token, absent otherwise.  Indicates the proof-of-possession key
      bound to the token.
   o  "rs_cnf" in the token response AS -> C, OPTIONAL to indicate the
      public key of the RS if it has one.  This parameter MUST only
      contain a representation of an asymmetric key.
   o  "rs_cnf" in the introspection response AS -> RS, OPTIONAL to
      indicate to the RS which asymmetric key pair to use for
      authenticating to the client if the RS has several public keys.
      This parameter MUST only contain a representation of an asymmetric
      key.

   Note that the COSE_Key structure in a confirmation claim or parameter
   may contain an "alg" or "key_ops" parameter.  If such parameters are
   present, a client MUST NOT use a key that is not compatible with the
   profile or proof-of-possession algorithm according to those
   parameters.  An RS MUST reject a proof-of-possession using such a
   key.

   If an access token is issued for an audience that includes several
   RS, the "rs_cnf" parameter MUST NOT be used, since the client cannot
   determine for which RS the key applies.  This document recommends to
   specify a different endpoint that the client can use to acquire RS
   authentication keys in such cases.  The specification of such an
   endpoint is out of scope for this document.

6.  CBOR Mappings

   If CBOR is used, the new parameters and claims defined in this
   document MUST be mapped to CBOR types as specified in Figure 1, using
   the given integer abbreviation for the map key.

       /-----------------+----------+----------------------------------\
       | Parameter name  | CBOR Key | Value Type                       |
       |-----------------+----------+----------------------------------|
       | cnf             |  8       | map                              |
       | rs_cnf          | 17       | map                              |
       | req_aud         | 18       | text string                      |
       | req_cnf         | 19       | map                              |

Appendix A.  Overlap with OAuth work

   This document overlaps with draft work from OAuth, namely
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-pop-key-distribution] and
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-resource-indicators].

   The former specifies the use of "req_cnf" and "cnf" for requesting
   proof-of-possession tokens and indicating the key that the AS has
   selected.  It it was initially deemed that the work at OAuth had been
   discontinued and therefore equivalent functionality was defined here.
   Work in OAuth has since resumed, but it is lagging behind the planned
   milestones of the ACE working group.  We have therefore split this
   work out into a separate document so that it can later be updated or
   obsoleted to align it with the final result of the OAuth work,
   without affecting [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz].

   The latter defines the use of the "resource" parameter, allowing to
   indicate the location fo the target service or resource where access
   is being requested.  This partially overlaps with the "req_aud"
   parameter specified here, however the definition of "req_aud" is more
   broad, since it can be used in an application specific way that is
   not necessarily bound to the location of the target audience (e.g. a
